In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up** Zoho CRM **OAuth2 credentials and configuring the auth setup. So, let's begin.

## **Setting up Zoho CRM**

In this section, we'll go through the process of creating a Server based Application and setting up Zoho to access the credentials.

> **Note: **If you already have a Server based application in Zoho API Console and can access the Client ID and Client Secret, you can skip to Step 3.

## **Step 1: Create an Application**

Visit the [Zoho API Console](https://api-console.zoho.com/) and create a **Server-based Application** (since our redirect URI points to a backend endpoint).

A Client based app uses a SPA to perform the application logic directly in the browser so you will need a Javascript origin URI to create a **Client App**. You can learn more about the types of Applications in the [Zoho OAuth 2.0 Glossary](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth-terminology.html).

## **Step 2: Fill Out Application Details**

When creating the app, use the following configuration:

- **Client Name:**`Test Application`

- **Homepage URL:**`https://backend.composio.dev`

- **Authorized Redirect URIs:**`https://backend.composio.dev/api/v1/auth-apps/add`

Once you save this configuration, Zoho will generate your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## **Step 3: Configure Scopes**

Zoho's Developer Console doesn't let you manually add scopes.
Instead, Composio provides a **"Manage Scopes"** field where you can define the access level your integration requires. When creating an Auth Config for Zoho in Composio, scroll down to **Manage Scopes** and add or remove scopes as needed.

You can learn more about OAuth scopes in the [Zoho Books API documentation](https://www.zoho.com/books/api/v3/oauth/#scopes).

By default, Composio pre-enables these scopes for Zoho CRM integrations:

## **Additional Useful Scopes (Optional)**

If you need to extend access, here are some specific Zoho CRM scopes you can safely use:

> **Note: **Only add what you actually need, unnecessary scopes may cause extra consent prompts

## **Step 4: Creating the Auth Config in Composio**

Once you have your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Zoho:

1. Go to your **Composio Dashboard**.

1. Click **Create Auth Config** â†’ select **Zoho CRM** from the list.

1. Ensure the authentication type is **OAuth2** (default).

1. Add your scopes under **Manage Scopes**, or use the defaults above.

1. Enable "**Use your own developer credentials**".

1. Paste in the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

Finally, click **Create Zoho Auth Config**.

## **Step 5: Using Your Auth Config**

Once created, you can find your `auth_config_id` (starts with `ac_`) in the **Manage Auth Configs** tab.
Use this ID in your application or agent to authenticate and interact with Zoho CRM via Composio.

Your Zoho CRM OAuth integration is now fully configured and ready to roll. ðŸš€
