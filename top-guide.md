OpenClaw is growing fast and if you've used it for anything beyond general tasks, you've probably noticed the gap. 

It handles most things, but specialized work like research, UI/UX design, writing, or reverse engineering? The output quality just isn't there. 

That's the problem SKILLS solves!

It's a single file that plugs into OpenClaw and gives it deep, domain-specific context - purpose-built instructions for doing one thing exceptionally well. Better context in, better output out.

The catch? OpenClaw's own ClawdHub has hundreds of these skills, and roughly 80% are garbage or outright malicious. Finding the good ones takes time. 

Last week I did that work and here's what's actually worth using.

---

### TL DR;

- OpenClaw skils are single-file plugins that give OpenClaw deep, domain-specific context to go from generic output to expert-level results.

- 80% of ClawHub skills are garbage or malicious, so vet carefully; the ones listed here are already filtered for quality (even though some show malignant, most are vetted by security teams).

- **Composio** - One integration that unlocks 860+ external tools (GitHub, Slack, Gmail, etc.) so you can build full AI agents without touching auth pipelines.

- **Reverse Engineering** - Turns OpenClaw into a network analyst that captures traffic, decodes binary protocols, and spits out clean parsers and docs.

- **Frontend Design** - Forces OpenClaw past generic purple-gradient output into bold, production-grade UI with real aesthetic intent.

- **Self-Improving Agent** - Logs errors, learnings, and preferences into memory so OpenClaw gets smarter and more personalized over time.

- **Eleven Labs Agent** - Gives OpenClaw a real voice and a failsafe: if email or text fails, it literally calls someone instead.

- **N8N Workflow** - Chat-driven control over your local N8N instance - trigger complex automations without subscriptions or a dashboard.

- **Exa Search** - Replaces generic browsing with a developer-focused index pulling from actual docs, GitHub repos, and coding forums.

- **Vercel** - Plain English commands that translate directly into Vercel CLI actions - deploy, rollback, debug, no terminal needed.

- **OpenAI Whisper** - Runs Whisper locally so you get fast, accurate transcriptions without your audio ever hitting a third-party server.

- **Home Assistant** - Natural language control over your entire smart home, fully local, zero cloud dependency.

![Image 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunilcomposio/notion-to-github/main/images/top/image_2.png)

- Navigate down and copy the command given after verifying Security Scan says Benign for Openclaw (vvi)

- Head to the terminal where open claw is installed and paste it. For me its docker and its the same skill I will install!

```c#
# installs clawhub
npx clawhub@latest install sonoscli
```

```c#
# or you can use github
git clone https://github.com/peterskoett/self-improving-agent.git ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/self-improving-agent
```

> **Caution**: Never install the calwdhub skills directly with clawdhub directly, without visiting the clawdhub website and verifying security

You can ensure it is active, by going to calwdbot dashboard and checking skills section!

![Image 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunilcomposio/notion-to-github/main/images/top/image_3.png)

With this understanding, we are ready to explore all the plugins I found out to be good. 

***Spoiler: you already installed 1 of them!***

## Top Skills to use with OpenClaw

### 1. Composio

This one personally I use the most and it genuinely delivers. 

It gives OpenClaw access to 860+ external tools through a single integration framework, meaning you can build AI agents that talk to GitHub, Slack, Gmail, and hundreds of other services without writing a single custom authentication pipeline. 

Whether you're building autonomous agents or traditional apps, this skill handles all the heavy lifting.

To install this skill, 

- in terminal navigate to `/home/<username>/.openclaw/skills`  

- and run `npx skills add composiohq/skills`  

- select Openclaw, rest keep default.

Once done you will see composio folder under skills section:

![Image 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunilcomposio/notion-to-github/main/images/top/image_4.png)

This is also a good example of how open claw keep their skills and what happens under the hood when you use clawdhub to install skills.

**Use Cases:**

- Building interactive, chat-based AI agents that securely access external services like Gmail or Slack via isolated MCP sessions.

  - prompt: *"Create an agent that monitors my Gmail and summarizes unread emails every morning."*

- Developing multi-tenant SaaS applications that require programmatic execution of external tools and manual authentication management.

  - *prompt: "Set up a direct execution flow for managing GitHub repos across multiple user accounts."*

- Setting up event-driven automation workflows that listen for real-time triggers and process verified incoming webhooks.

  -  prompt: *"Create a workflow that triggers whenever a new Stripe payment is received."*

---

### Reverse Engineering

![Image 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunilcomposio/notion-to-github/main/images/top/image_5.png)

Ever wanted to reverse engineer a tool, app, or web service to understand exactly how it communicates under the hood - this skill is built for that. 

It turns OpenClaw into an elite network analyst, capable of capturing raw traffic, dissecting unknown protocols, and translating binary data into clean documentation and custom parsers. 

Whether it's security research, debugging, or system interoperability, this skill gives you full visibility into any network communication.

Use with caution & you can install it at: [Reverse Engineering](https://skills.sh/wshobson/agents/protocol-reverse-engineering)

**Use Cases:**

- Capturing and analyzing raw network traffic to uncover vulnerabilities or undocumented features in proprietary communication protocols.

  - prompt: *"Capture and analyze traffic from this app and identify any undocumented endpoints."*

- Developing custom Wireshark dissectors (Lua) and Python parsers to map out complex binary structures and fixed headers.

  - prompt: “*Write a Wireshark Lua dissector for this binary protocol sample."*

- Performing entropy analysis and TLS fingerprinting (JA3/JA3S) to identify encryption methods and extract hidden metadata. 

  - *prompt: "Run entropy analysis on this packet capture and identify the encryption layer."*

But use cases are infinite, for e.g my friend reverse engineered entire product to build it better.

### 2. Frontend Design 

![Image 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunilcomposio/notion-to-github/main/images/top/image_6.png)

OpenClaw can build frontend apps out of the box, but the output is generic at best - the usual Inter font, purple gradients, and safe layouts.

If you're a frontend developer or UI/UX designer, this skill is non-negotiable. 

It forces OpenClaw into a master-level design mindset, demanding bold aesthetic direction, intentional typography, and production-grade interfaces before a single line of code is written.

You can install this skill at: [frontend-design by anthropics/skills](https://skills.sh/anthropics/skills/frontend-design) (yup its by anthropic!)

**Use Cases:**

- Rapidly prototyping highly distinctive landing pages that immediately stand out from competitor templates.

  - prompt: *"Build me a landing page with a brutalist aesthetic for a SaaS product."*

- Translating abstract brand vibes into fully functional, production-ready frontend code 

  - *prompt: "Design a site that feels like an editorial fashion magazine, dark and high contrast."*

- Breaking out of cookie-cutter design ruts by forcing unexpected layout choices and non-standard typography pairings 

  - prompt:  *"Redesign this hero section, avoid any standard layouts or default fonts."*

and more!

### **3. Self-Improving Agent** 

Clawdbot already has some self-improvement capability, this skill takes it to the next level.

It dynamically tracks interactions, logging errors, active learnings, and feature requests into a dedicated memory folder.

This gives the bot a structured layer of intelligence that makes it more accurate over time, not just responsive.

Can be dowloaded from clawdhub at [Self-Improving-Agent - ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/pskoett/self-improving-agent)

**Use Cases:**

- Continuously logging errors to prevent the bot from repeating past mistakes 

  - prompt: *"Remember this error and avoid it next time."*

- Storing user preferences and learnings for a tailored experience over time 

  - prompt: *"Remember I prefer concise responses"* or *"Log this as a learning."*

---

### 4. Eleven Labs Agent

If you are into voice-ai and tooling / your job requires ai calling services, this skill is a game changer.

It integrates directly with the 11Labs CLI, giving OpenClaw an actual voice and bridging the gap between text-based AI operations and real-world audio interactions.

Most interesting is fail safe mechanism: if clawbot failed to send text message or email fails, the bot automatically pivots to making a real phone call instead.

You can install the skills from at [ElevenLabs Agents - ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/PennyroyalTea/elevenlabs-agents) . Make sure you have your Eleven Lab’s API Key

**Use Cases:**

- Acting as a fallback to physically call people or businesses if text-based emails or messages fail to send 

  - prompt: *"If the email fails, call them instead."*

- Automating voice-based tasks like making reservations or handling customer service inquiries on your behalf. 

  - prompt: *"Call and book a table for 2 at 7pm"* or *"Call support and follow up on my order."*

- Generating voiced summaries or updates for hands-free productivity 

  - prompt:  *"Read out my task list for today"* or *"Give me a voice update on pending emails.*

---

### 5. N8N Workflow

You've probably used N8N - and if so, you already know that running enterprise-level automations burns cash fast. 

This skill connects OpenClaw directly to your N8N instance, letting you spin up, manage, and trigger complex multi-step workflows using cron jobs & plain chat  

This means no expensive subscriptions, no manual dashboard, just automation on demand & best part - entire process runs on local version, so data remins private.

You can install it at: [n8n workflow automation - ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/KOwl64/n8n-workflow-automation).

**Use Cases:**

- Triggering an automated sequence to create and post LinkedIn updates the moment a new podcast goes live.

  - *prompt: "When a new podcast episode drops, draft and post a LinkedIn update automatically."*

- Setting up complex, multi-app workflows entirely through conversational commands 

  -  prompt: *"Create a workflow that saves every Gmail attachment to Dropbox and notifies me on Slack."*

- Automating repetitive data tasks like scraping, formatting, and sending weekly reports 

  - prompt:*"Every Monday at 9am, pull last week's analytics and email me a summary."*

---

### **6. Exa Search**

OpenClaw supports browsing, but for technical work, general search just doesn't cut it as it surfaces SEO blogs over actual documentation. 

Exa fixes that by connecting OpenClaw directly to a search index built for developers, pulling from GitHub repos, technical docs, and coding forums instead. 

If you write code regularly, this is the skill that cuts hallucinations and gets you accurate answers fast.

You can install the skill at: [Exa - ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/fardeenxyz/exa) 

> You require an EXA_API_KEY while setup

**Use Cases:**

- Pulling the most up-to-date coding documentation and API references for web development.

  - prompt: *"Find the latest React 19 docs on server components."*

- Searching the web specifically for highly technical programming solutions and developer resources. 

  - prompt: *"Search Exa for the best open-source alternatives to Stripe's API."*

- Finding real-world code examples and GitHub repos for a specific implementation.

  - prompt: *"Find me a GitHub repo that implements JWT authentication in Node.js."*

---

### 7. Vercel

If deploying sites to Vercel is second nature to you, this skill just makes it faster and automated. 

It connects OpenClaw directly to the Vercel CLI, translating plain conversational commands into the exact terminal scripts needed to deploy, manage, and update your projects. 

No manual terminal work required anymore

You can install this skill at: [Vercel Platform - ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/TheSethRose/vercel)

**Use Cases:**

- Deploying new websites, applications, and web projects using simple natural language prompts.

  - prompt*: "Deploy this project to Vercel."*

- Managing cloud hosting environments and triggering project builds without typing complex terminal commands. 

  - prompt: *"Trigger a new build for my production environment"* or *"Roll back to the last stable deployment."*

- Checking deployment status and debugging failed builds on the fly 

  - prompt: *"Why did my last deployment fail?"* or *"Show me the build logs for my latest push."*

---

### **8. OpenAI Whisper**

If you're a developer and content creator, you already know how valuable accurate transcriptions are, and uploading sensitive audio to third-party services isn't always an option. 

This skill runs OpenAI's Whisper model locally on your machine, giving you fast, accurate transcriptions without your audio ever leaving your system.

This means anyone can turn spoken word into text regularly. It requires an OpenAI API key and relies on a local installation.

You can install this skill at: [Openai Whisper - ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/steipete/openai-whisper)

**Use Cases:**

- Transcribing audio and video files completely offline for maximum privacy 

  - prompt: *"Transcribe this audio file locally."*

- Quickly converting meeting recordings or voice notes into highly accurate text documents 

  - prompt: *"Convert this meeting recording to text"* or *"Transcribe my voice note and clean it up."*

- Generating subtitles or captions for video content without a paid tool 

  - prompt: just say *"Transcribe this video and format the output as subtitles."*

---

### 9. Home Assistant & Extras

Personally, I haven’t used it, but few of my friends say its game changing in home automation.

It connects OpenClaw directly to a local Home Assistant setup, letting you control your entire home through fluid natural language.

This means no rigid routines, no cloud dependency, no data leaving your network. 

You can install it at: [Home Assistant - ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/iAhmadZain/home-assistant)

**Use Cases:**

- Controlling smart lights, locks, and appliances locally via natural language commands 

  - prompt: *"Turn off all the lights in the living room"* or *"Lock the front door."*

- Creating dynamic, AI-driven home automation routines without complex coding 

  - prompt:  *"Every night at 10pm, dim the bedroom lights and lock all doors."*

- Checking and managing the status of all connected devices in one place 

  -  prompt: *"Which devices are currently on?"* or *"Show me everything that's active in the house right now."*

Isn’t this one insane? Turning a conversational ai bot into a localized, privacy-first smart home hub.

This wraps up most of the skills I found useful, some extra includes:

- **Model Usage:** Monitors and reports API token consumption and usage statistics across various AI providers.

- **WhatsApp CLI:** Allows you to draft, approve, and send WhatsApp messages hands-free using natural language prompts.

- **Bird (Twitter/X):** Interacts with X (formerly Twitter) to search for keywords, check feeds, and pull social data directly into the chat.

- **YouTube Summarizer:** Extracts and summarizes YouTube video transcripts to help generate descriptions, headlines, and social copy.

- **GA4 Analysis:** Connects to Google Analytics 4 to provide automated, natural language summaries of your website's traffic and performance data.

- **GNO:** Acts as a local document search indexer that uses BM25 vector hybrid search to retrieve AI-generated answers from your personal files.
